<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In Software II - Advanced C#, I built upon the object-oriented programming skills I developed in Software I, focusing on creating applications that interact with databases and file servers using C#. The course introduced advanced topics, including the use of lambda expressions for more efficient coding, working with collections to manage data, and enhancing application stability through advanced error handling. Additionally, I learned how to create applications that accommodate users in different regions through localization and globalization.

For my project, I developed a desktop scheduling application for a global consulting company using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and a MySQL database. This project involved implementing features such as managing customer records, scheduling appointments, adjusting for time zones, and generating reports. It allowed me to apply the concepts I learned in a real-world scenario, providing valuable hands-on experience with advanced C# techniques while building a comprehensive, database-driven application that met global business needs. Overall, the course deepened my understanding of C# and equipped me to develop more complex applications.


### Built With

* .NET
* Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)


## Course Information

Software II - Advanced C# refines object-oriented programming expertise and builds database and file server application development skills. You will learn about and put into action lambda expressions, collections, and input/output to develop software with C# that meets business requirements. This course requires intermediate expertise in object-oriented programming and the C# language. The prerequisite for this course is Software I - C#.

### Competencies

**Database and File Server Applications**

The graduate produces database and file server applications using advanced constructs in a high-level programming language to meet business requirements.

**Lambda**

The graduate incorporates lambda expressions in application development to meet business requirements more efficiently.

**Collections**

The graduate incorporates nongeneric collections and generic collections in application development to manipulate data more efficiently.

**Localization and Globalization**

The graduate applies application programming interfaces (APIs) in application development to support end users in various geographic regions.

**Advanced Exception Control**

The graduate incorporates advanced exception control mechanisms in application development for improving user experience and application stability.

### Scenario

You are working for a software company that has been contracted to develop a scheduling desktop user interface application. The contract is with a global consulting organization that conducts business in multiple languages and has main offices in the following locations: Phoenix, Arizona; New York, New York; and London, England. The consulting organization has provided a MySQL database that your C# application must pull data from. However, this database is used for other systems, so its structure cannot be modified.

The organization has outlined specific business requirements that must be included as part of the application. From these requirements, a system analyst at your company created solution statements for you to implement when developing the application.

### Requirements

* Create a login form that determines a user's location and translates to the localized language
* Provide the ability to add, update, and delete customer records with validation
* Add exception handling that can be used when performing each of the operations for customer records
* Provide the ability to add, update, and delete appointments, capture the type of appointment, and link to a specific customer record in the database
* Create a calendar view feature, including the ability to view appointments on a specific day by selecting a day of the month from a calendar of the months of the year
* Provide the ability to automatically adjust appointment times based on user time zones and daylight saving time
* Create a function that allows users to generate the three reports listed using collection classes, incorporating a lambda expression into the code
* Record the timestamp and the username of each login in a text file named “Login_History.txt,” ensuring that each new record is appended to the log file
